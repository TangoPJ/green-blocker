# Green Blocker

A [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/green-blocker/bddacdohgmaebklmbambdhpopdkadkdg) that temporarily blocks destructing websites in a polite and lovely manner.

## Motivation

I'm a developer and I spend a lot of time in front of a computer. I also have a lot of hobbies that I want to spend time on. I found myself spending too much time on websites that I didn't want to spend time on. I tried a lot of different extensions and apps to block websites, but I found them to be too harsh and not very polite. I wanted something that would block websites in a polite and loving manner. So I created Green Blocker.
